-useRef is a React hook that returns a "mutable ref object" that persists across renders.
-and "allows you to access "the "DOM nodes" or "values of other elements".
-.current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue).
-This ref object persists throughout the lifetime of the component, enabling you to store and maintain references to DOM elements 
or any other mutable value.
-useRef can also be used to "store mutable values that persist across renders" without "causing re-renders".
-Using useRef can help "avoid unnecessary re-renders", which can be "crucial for performance optimization".
-if you need to keep a value "that should not cause re-renders" when "updated, useRef is the perfect tool".
-useRef can also be used to access "previous props or state values", 
which is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to compare current and previous values.


usestate & useref :
useRef returns a mutable object that does not trigger re-renders when updated, 
while useState returns a state value and a function to update it, which causes the component to re-render.
