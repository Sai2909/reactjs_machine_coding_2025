=>Th contextapi in react, coupled with the usecontext hook, provides way to share data or state across multiple components
=>without laying on prop drilling.
=>Prop drilling refers to the practice of passing props through multiple levels of components which can become difficult to maintain in large or complex applications
Benfits of contextapi
=>Reduced Prop drilling
=>Simplified component structure
Prop drilling complicates the component structure, making it harder to track where data is coming from and leading to code
that is more challenging to maintain. With the Context API, you can provide data at a high level and access it from any component, simplifying the structure.
=>Easier Maintenance and Scalability
=>Centralized State Management
