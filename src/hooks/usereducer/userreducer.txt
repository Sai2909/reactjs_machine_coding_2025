useReducer is a React Hook that allows you to manage complex state logic in functional components by using a reducer function,
similar to Redux. It is particularly useful when state transitions require complex logic, multiple state variables,
or if you need a consistent pattern for updating state.
useReducer provides an alternative to useState for managing state in more complex scenarios.

syntax:
-useReducer hook accepts two arguments: a "reducer function" and an "initial state".
- It "returns" the "current state" and a "dispatch function" to "trigger state changes".

const[state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducer,initialState);

reducer: A "function" that "takes the current state" and an "action", and "returns" the "new state".
initialState: The "initial value of the state".
state: The current state.
dispatch: A function used to send actions to the reducer.

when to use:
-Complex state logic: When state transitions are complex and involve multiple sub-values
-Centralized state updates: When multiple components need to update the same state.


what diff b/w useReducer amd usestate?
-useReducer is a hook used for "managing complex state logic" in React. While useState is suitable for "simple state updates".
-useReducer is more powerful for handling "state transitions that involve multiple actions".
