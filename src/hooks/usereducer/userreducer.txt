-useReducer is a React Hook that provides an alternative way to "manage state" in functional components,
-especially when the "state logic" is "complex" or "involves multiple sub-values". It is conceptually similar to reducers in Redux.

syntax:
-useReducer hook accepts two arguments: a "reducer function" and an "initial state".
- It "returns" the "current state" and a "dispatch function" to "trigger state changes".

const[state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducer,initialState);

reducer: A "function" that "takes the current state" and an "action", and "returns" the "new state".
initialState: The "initial value of the state".
